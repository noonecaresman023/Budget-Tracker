Budget Track Web App


Note: This project is still in the design phase

Budget Tracker is a personal web project aimed at simplifying the management of finances. This app provides an alternative to using Excel or Google Sheets, making it accessible through both mobile and desktop devices. Unlike many personal finance managers that have paywalls for essential features, Budget Tracker aims to offer a free, easy-to-use tool for tracking finances. This project also stems from a personal passion for financial management and the desire to create a tool that others can easily utilize.
